# LaTeX exam generator

## Abstract
The program selects questions at random from a list (such that the total points is 100) and creates an exam from them. It creates a LaTeX document and compiles it to generate the corresponding pdf. The file can from there be utilised at convenience.

## Status
Currently functional, but yet in progress.
